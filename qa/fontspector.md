    <summary>⚠️ <b>WARN</b> Check for codepoints not covered by METADATA subsets. (googlefonts/metadata/unreachable_subsetting)</summary>
    <div>


> This check ensures that all encoded glyphs in the font are covered by a subset declared in the METADATA.pb. Google Fonts splits the font into a set of subset fonts based on the contents of the `subsets` field and the subset definitions in the `glyphsets` repository.
> 
> Any encoded glyphs which are not by any of these subset definitions will not be served in the subsetted fonts, and so will be unreachable to the end user.
